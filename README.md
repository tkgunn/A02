DEFINITIONS 
Branch: A branch in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. It represents an independent line of development. Branches allow you to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Clone: Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a Git repository on your local machine. This copy includes the entire project's history and allows you to work on it independently.
Commit: A commit in Git is a snapshot of the changes made to the code at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes information about the changes, author, and timestamp.
Fetch: The `git fetch` command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them into your working branch. It allows you to see what changes are on the remote repository before pulling or merging.
Git: Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage versions, and track changes efficiently.
GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development using Git. It offers features like collaboration, bug tracking, code review, and hosting repositories.
Merge: Merging in Git combines changes from different branches into a single branch. It's a way to integrate changes and reconcile differences between branches.
Merge Conflict: A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches. This usually happens when two branches have made conflicting changes to the same part of a file.
Push: Pushing in Git refers to uploading local changes to a remote repository. It makes your committed changes available to others who are collaborating on the same project.
Pull: Pulling is the process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into the local branch. It is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.
Remote: A remote in Git refers to a version of the repository stored on another server. It can be on the same machine or a different location, such as GitHub or GitLab.
Repository: A repository, or repo, in Git is a collection of files and version history stored in a directory. It includes all the project files and metadata necessary for version control.
